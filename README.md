The live front-end CSS and JS editor for the UI developer who is ready to Hack The Planet!!

### Create Spartan UI Editor Bookmarklet

* Create a browser bookmark like you normally would.
* Name it whatever you want.
* Then fill in the URL field with the following JS code, editing the version number (i.e.. @0.9.0.3) to match the latest version of Spartan:

`javascript:(function(){const script = document.createElement('script');script.src = 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/cobaltapps/spartan-ui-editor@0.9.0.3/spartan-ui-editor.js';script.async = false;document.head.appendChild(script)})();`

Once you've created this bookmarklet you should be able to just click it on any website with a traditional "body" container and you should see the Spartan UI Editor popup, **ready to serve with courage and honor!**
